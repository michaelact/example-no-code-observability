## Issue: Grafana Dashboard Not Displaying Data

**Note:** DeepFlow Server must run on Kubernetes (K8s). However, for a simple exploration, I used the [All-in-one quick deployment with Docker Compose](https://www.deepflow.io/docs/ce-install/all-in-one/#deploying-with-docker-compose) for the DeepFlow server installation and followed the instructions for [Monitoring a legacy server](https://www.deepflow.io/docs/ce-install/legacy-host/) for the DeepFlow agent installation. Everything appears to be running.

Here are the running containers:

```

```

Unfortunately, I see nothing on the Grafana dashboard.

### Troubleshooting Steps

According to the [FAQ](https://www.deepflow.io/docs/diagnose/FAQ/), if there is no data on Grafana after deployment:

1. **Check if all Pods are running normally:** Execute `kubectl get pods -n deepflow` and confirm that all Pods are in the Running state.
   - *Note:* I am using Docker Compose, not Kubernetes. All containers are running as shown above.

2. **Check the connection between DeepFlow Agent and DeepFlow Server:**
   - Verify if the service domain has been successfully created using `deepflow-ctl domain list`.
   - Check if the `STATE` is `NORMAL` using `deepflow-ctl agent list`.
   - I have verified whether the deepflow-agent running or not, it don't change the state, only `NORMAL`.

I am still unsure where the failure occurs.

As DeepFlow continues to translate their documentation from Chinese, I hope future versions will provide clearer installation guide & explanations.
